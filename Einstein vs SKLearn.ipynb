    "## Initial Results\n",
    "The initial accuracy results are **100%**.  This is a gigantic red-flag when looking at any data set.  However, it's not surprising given how the data was created.  Let's look at this in more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Features being used to predict are Candidate Name and Application Status.  However, when you reduce the data down to the 48 fields that can be used for training and testing you see that the lable (Accepted Offer) has a 1 to 1 correlation with the Application Status field.  Instead of using machine learning this could be reduced to the simple rule \n",
    "\n",
    "- If Applicants accepted status is Accepted Offer then Accepted Offer is equal to yes\n",
    "- If Applications accepted status is Rejected Offer then Accepted Offer is equal to no\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have figured this out initially just by looking at our two fields.  The fields being used to predict on are a Name Field, which is different for every student, and the Application Status itself.  Note that Application Status is both a field they are predicting on AND the field you are trying to predict for!  So you are essentially encoding your predictions directly into your model.  What good is that?  Additionally when we go out to predict on the generalized data the data values within the Application Status field are \"Offer Made\" or \"Applied\".  They don't exist within the training data at all, so how would the algorithms learn to predict on them?\n",
    "\n",
    "So either the system is essentially random (trying to figure out how to predict if a student will accept based on their name) OR it's using more than just the two fields setup in the predictions.  SalesForce Einstein is very opaque on what they are doing behind the scenes, they just say things like \"we have a ton of data, build our models around that and leverage those models on your predictions\". \n",
    "\n",
    "What's also interesting is that given the lables are actually encoded into the features directly, SalesForce predictions in the `Predicted Likelihood to Accept Offer` field are not 100% accurate on the fields that have `Accepted Offer` or `Rejected Offer` within the Application Status field.  This would indicate that something else is really going on behind the scenes. \n",
    "\n",
    "So....  Let's try a more robust model where we used more of the features to try and predict the outcome. "
   ]

    "## Implementation 2: Create Train/Test data on more features\n",
    "Looking at the data set there are a number of other fields that we could use to predict upon.  For instance there in informaiton on which field they are applying for, which degree, where they are from, etc..   Intuitively it would seem that some of these fields could be **much** more predictive than Application Status and Name.  For instance if the college is in San Francisco, someone in San Jose may be more likely to accept than someone in, say, Chicago.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So looking at the data we see a few things.  First, everyone has a Mailing State of CA.  Well that means, for this test, that the field really is not usefull.  Degree Field is Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering.  This could be good data.  Also the Degree type (Bachelors, Ph.D., Masters) is a helpful field.  After analyzing the data we will use the following fields for this prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Degree`: Values of Bachelors, Ph.D, and Masters\n",
    "- `Degree Field` : Values of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Mechanical Engineerings\n",
    "- `Mailing City`: Many different values but city may correlate to likelihood to accept. \n",
    "- `Postal Code`: A bit more general than Mailing City and it may be dupicative.  This could have the effect of essentially enhancing the effect of location on the model.  Let's see!\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note:** that we are NOT using the Application Status or Canidate Name field.  This is because Application Stutus essentially IS the label.  Additionally it is also hard to understand how name would help the model predict.  \n"
